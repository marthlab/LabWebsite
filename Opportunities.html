    We are looking for graduate students interested in completing a Ph.D. in computational biology. Graduate students will enter through 
    the <a href="http://www.bioscience.utah.edu/molecular-biology/index.php">University of Utah Molecular Biology Program</a>. Interested 
    students considering the Marth laboratory should email Dr. Gabor Marth directly at gmarth@genetics.utah.edu.
  </div>
  <div style="font-size:24px; color:rgb(80,80,80); padding-top: 25px;">
    We also have several postdoctoral positions available, for highly trained computational biologists with algorithmic software 
    development experience (for our algorithm development projects), and for individuals who are interested in (and have experience with) 
    developing web-based genomic analysis software. Contact Dr. Marth directly at gmarth@genetics.utah.edu.
